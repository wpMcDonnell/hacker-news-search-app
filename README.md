# Hacker News Search App

Using the hn.algolia.com/api, I re-created Hacker News using Javascript and React. Users will arrive at the search page and be able to search by title, comments, or author using a search bar. THey may also refine their search by time (all time, last 24 hrs, or last year). Users may then navigate to the history tab where they may see their previous searches from the session.
