# Hacker News Search App

Using the https://hn.algolia.com/api, I re-created Hacker News using Javascript and React. Users will arrive at the About page and be able to navigate to /search or /history pages. In /search, users will be able to search by title, comments, or author using a search bar. They may also refine their search by time (all time, last 24 hrs, or last year) as well as sort their search by date or popularity. Users may then navigate to the history tab where they may see their previous searches from the session and clear search results if they wish.
